You will need to be the league admin to make changes.

### Bonus points

1-3 points are awarded to the players that receive the most BPS (Bonus Points System) in a match.

Bonus point ties are resolved as follows:

- If there is a tie for first place, Players 1 & 2 will receive 3 points each and Player 3 will receive 1 point.
- If there is a tie for second place, Player 1 will receive 3 points and Players 2 and 3 will receive 2 points each.
- If there is a tie for third place, Player 1 will receive 3 points, Player 2 will receive 2 points and Players 3 & 4 will receive 1 point each.

BPS is calculated as follows:

| Action | BPS |
|--------|-----|
| Playing 1 to 60 minutes | 3 |
| Playing over 60 minutes | 6 |
| Goalkeepers and defenders scoring a goal | 12 |
| Midfielders scoring a goal | 18 |
| Forwards scoring a goal | 24 |
| Assists | 9 |
| Goalkeepers and defenders keeping a clean sheet | 12 |
| Saving a penalty | 9 |
| Save | 2 |
| Successful open play cross | 1 |
| Creating a big chance (a chance where the receiving player should score) | 3 |
| For every 2 clearances, blocks and interceptions (total) | 1 |
| For every 3 recoveries | 1 |
| Key pass | 1 |
| Successful tackle (net*) | 2 |
| Successful dribble | 1 |
| Scoring the goal that wins a match | 3 |
| Goalline clearance | 3 |
| Foul won | 1 |
| Shot on target | 2 |
| 70 to 79% pass completion (at least 30 passes attempted) | 2 |
| 80 to 89% pass completion (at least 30 passes attempted) | 4 |
| 90%+ pass completion (at least 30 passes attempted) | 6 |
| Goalkeeper/defender conceding a goal | -4 |
| Conceding a penalty | -3 |
| Missing a penalty | -6 |
| Yellow card | -3 |
| Red card | -9 |
| Own goal | -6 |
| Missing a big chance | -3 |
| Making an error which leads to a goal | -3 |
| Making an error which leads to an attempt at goal | -1 |
| Being tackled | -1 |
| Conceding a foul | -1 |
| Being caught offside | -1 |
| Shot off target | -1 |

#### Enabling or disabling bonus points in custom scoring

If you want bonus points on, then keep it set to 1-1-1-1 in the custom scoring system.
If you want bonus points off, then set it to 0-0-0-0.

You can leave BPS as is with 0-0-0-0, unless you want to award points for BPS scored.

If you were to set Bonus to 2-2-2-2, then players would receive 2/4/6 points as bonus points.
If you were to set BPS to 1-1-1-1, and a player scores 30 BPS, then they'd be awarded 30 points.

### Kante Points

We added the Kante rule to award players like N'Golo KantÃ© that are critical in a match, but typically do not score well in fantasy football.
Where N'Golo Kante would excel is tackles and interceptions, but in the default scoring system this stat does not earn any points.
You can award players points for interceptions and tackles, but when we originally introduced Kante Points, this was not an option.
For managers that prefer to use the original Kante points rules, we have added a setting to the scoring system for this.

The Kante points rule would award 1 point for every 2 tackles and/or interceptions for midfielders and forwards.

To set this, you can set `Tackle/Interception` to 1 and `Per no of tackles/interceptions` to 2 for midfielders and forwards.
So it should look like this:

| Player position | Tackle/Interception | Per no of tackles/interceptions |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Goalkeeper      | 0                   | 0                            |
| Defender        | 0                   | 0                            |
| Midfielder      | 1                   | 2                            |
| Forward         | 1                   | 2                            |

Of course, you can adjust these values to your liking.
