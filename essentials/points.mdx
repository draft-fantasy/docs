### Bonus points

1-3 points are awarded to the players that receive the most BPS (Bonus Points System) in a match.

Bonus point ties are resolved as follows:

- If there is a tie for first place, Players 1 & 2 will receive 3 points each and Player 3 will receive 1 point.
- If there is a tie for second place, Player 1 will receive 3 points and Players 2 and 3 will receive 2 points each.
- If there is a tie for third place, Player 1 will receive 3 points, Player 2 will receive 2 points and Players 3 & 4 will receive 1 point each.

### Kante Points

We added the Kante rule to award players like N'Golo KantÃ© that are critical in a match, but typically do not score well in fantasy football.
Where Kante would excel is tackles and interceptions, but in the default scoring system this stat does not earn any points.
You can award players points for interceptions and tackles, but when we originally introduced Kante Points, this was not an option.
For managers that prefer to use the original Kante points rules, we have added a setting to the scoring system.

A Kante is defined as a tackle or an interception.
To award a Kante point for every 2 tackles and/or interceptions, you can set `Per no of kantes` to `2`.
To award a Kante point for every 3 tackles and/or interceptions, you can set `Per no of kantes` to `3`.
You can find this setting when clicking `Edit Custom Scoring`.
