## Download Players

You can download a CSV spreadsheet of players by going to [https://app.draftfantasy.com/api/players/csv](https://app.draftfantasy.com/api/players/csv).

## API

The API returns data in JSON format. To convert the data to CSV, you can use a tool like [JSON to CSV](https://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm).

### League

You can grab your league data via our API.
You can grab your league data, by making a `GET` request to `https://app.draftfantasy.com/api/v1/league/<LEAGUE_ID>`.
You'll need to replace `<LEAGUE_ID>` with your actual league ID.
For example, if you wanted to get the league with an ID of `abcde`, you would make a request to `https://app.draftfantasy.com/api/v1/league/abcde`.

### Draft

After the draft is complete, you can grab the draft data by making a `GET` request to `https://app.draftfantasy.com/api/v1/league/<LEAGUE_ID>/draft`.
You'll need to replace `<LEAGUE_ID>` with your actual league ID.
For example, if you wanted to get the draft with an ID of `abcde`, you would make a request to `https://app.draftfantasy.com/api/v1/league/abcde/draft`.
