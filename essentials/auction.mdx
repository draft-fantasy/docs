In an auction draft each team has a £250 budget.

On each turn there's a nomination phase, and a bidding phase.

In the nomination phase, the selected manager chooses a player to nominate for the auction.

They nominator automatically bids £1 for the player, and then there's a period of time (typically 30 seconds) where managers can bid on players. The manager that makes the highest bid wins the player, and the amount paid is subtracted from their balance.

The draft continues until everyone in the league has a full team of players (typically 15 players per team).

### Max bids

You can set max bids before or during the draft.

This is the most you are willing to pay for a player. We will automatically bid up to this amount for you. But we will only ever bid £1 more than the previous highest bid up to the maximum you have set.
You can continue to bid manually even after the maximum bid has been reached. But we won't automatically bid for you after this point.

For example, if you set a max bid of £80 for a player, and someone else bids £50, we will automatically bid £51 for you.
But if someone bids £80, we will no longer bid for you.

In the event that two players have a set maximum bids for a player, we will automatically bid up to the second highest bid and add £1.

For example, if you have a max bid of £80 for a player, and someone else has a max bid of £70, we will automatically bid £71 for you.

### Time per pick

The time per pick is set for each league. It's typically 30 seconds. But there will be a minimum of 10 seconds after any bid is made.

For example, if you make a bid with 20 seconds remaining, the clock will continue to count down from 20 seconds.
But if you make a bid with 3 seconds remaining, we will reset the clock to 10 seconds so that everyone has enough time to make a higher bid.

### When the clock runs out

If the clock runs out in the nomination phase, we will automatically pick a player for the nominator.

This will be as follows:

* The player with the highest max bid, that they are still able to pick.
* The player with the highest rating (as set by Draft Fantasy).

When the clock runs out in the bidding phase, the team with the highest bid wins the player.
