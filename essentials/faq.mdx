### What's the difference between the Free and Premium version of Draft Fantasy?

In the free version, you can only draft. But all functionality after the draft is locked off until you upgrade your league to premium.
The paid version unlocks the entire platform, allowing you to change your team, score points, and make trades.

### What happens if only part of my league upgrade to premium?

The league will remain in the free version until everyone upgrades to the paid version.
You can also purchase the single league package which automatically upgrades your league to the paid version.

### How do I contact support?

You can contact support via email at support@draftfantasy.com.
