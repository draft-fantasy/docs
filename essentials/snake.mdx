In a snake draft, managers pick players one at a time.
You can pick any unpicked player as long as the player fits into the squad constraints for the league.

Each round, the bidding order is reversed. Hence the name "Snake Draft".

The order in a 5 person snake draft is as follows:

**Round 1**:

* Manager 1 picks a player.
* Manager 2 picks a player.
* Manager 3 picks a player.
* Manager 4 picks a player.
* Manager 5 picks a player.

**Round 2**:

* Manager 5 picks a player.
* Manager 4 picks a player.
* Manager 3 picks a player.
* Manager 2 picks a player.
* Manager 1 picks a player.

**Round 3**:

* Manager 1 picks a player.
* Manager 2 picks a player.
* Manager 3 picks a player.
* Manager 4 picks a player.
* Manager 5 picks a player.

And so on. Typically there are 15 rounds of picks at which point the draft is complete.

## Auto Picks

If you run out of time, your autopick list is used to pick the next player for you.
You can also use the autopick list as a shortlist to pick from during the draft.

Offline managers aren't automatically autopicked for which did happen in previous versions of Draft Fantasy.
League admin can decide to end picking early for a manager by clicking "Force Pick" in the admin section at the top of the draft page.

## League Admin

The league admin section is located at the top of the draft page. It will only be visible to the league admin.

* League admin can end a user's turn before the timer runs out, by clicking "Force Pick" in the admin section at the top of the draft page.
* League admin can pause the draft.
* League admin can restart the draft.
* League admin can change the draft order before the draft starts.
