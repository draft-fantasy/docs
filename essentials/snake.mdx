In a snake draft, managers pick players one at a time.
You can pick any unpicked player as long as the player fits into the squad constraints for the league.

Each round, the bidding order is reversed. Hence the name "Snake Draft".

The order in a 5 person snake draft is as follows:

**Round 1**:

* Manager 1 picks a player.
* Manager 2 picks a player.
* Manager 3 picks a player.
* Manager 4 picks a player.
* Manager 5 picks a player.

**Round 2**:

* Manager 5 picks a player.
* Manager 4 picks a player.
* Manager 3 picks a player.
* Manager 2 picks a player.
* Manager 1 picks a player.

**Round 3**:

* Manager 4 picks a player.
* Manager 3 picks a player.
* Manager 2 picks a player.
* Manager 1 picks a player.
* Manager 5 picks a player.

And so on. Typically there are 15 rounds of picks at which point the draft is complete.
