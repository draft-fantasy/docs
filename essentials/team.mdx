## Valid Formations

The default formations allowed are:

| Position    | Minimum  | Maximum  |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Goalkeepers | 1        | 1        |
| Defenders   | 3        | 5        |
| Midfielders | 2        | 5        |
| Forwards    | 1        | 3        |

So for example, a 4-3-3 formation is valid, but a 6-3-1 formation is not, because more than 5 defenders are not allowed.

The allowed formations can also be customised by the league admin. To view the formation rules for your league, visit the `Settings` page from the dashboard.

### Substitutes

If a player in your starting lineup doesn't play, they are automatically replaced with a player from your substitutes.

The order of your substitutes matters. We will pick the first player in the list of substitutes (left most in `Pitch` view).

The formation constraints must still match. So we won't replace a defender that hasn't played with a goalkeeper if that leads to having 2 goalkeepers in the lineup.
