### Substitutes

If a player in your starting lineup doesn't play, they are automatically replaced with a player from your substitutes.

The order of your substitutes matters. We will pick the first player in the list of substitutes (left most in `Pitch` view).

The formation constraints must still match. So we won't replace a defender that hasn't played with a goalkeeper if that leads to having 2 goalkeepers in the lineup.
