Go to the `Transfers` page to make a trade.

There are 3 types of transfer:

1. **Free**: No one owns the player. The trade is executed immediately.
2. **Trade**: Someone else owns the player. The person you propose the trade to must accept the trade for it to be executed.
3. **Waiver Requests**: See the [waivers](/essentials/waivers) page for more information.
