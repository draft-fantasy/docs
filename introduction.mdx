## What is a draft?

We offer two types of drafts: Auction and Snake. In both formats each team is unique, but the difference is how players are picked.

    Each team starts with a balance of Â£250. You bid on players and the team with the highest bid receives the player.

    Players are picked one by one. The order is reversed each round which is why it's called a snake draft.
